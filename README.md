# GridStream-Power-Usage-Data
Working repository containing data dumps of assumed power readings and code to attempt decoding/decrypting

- **00FF00-03_RAW_Dataset.txt** - Raw unprocessed capture file for your hacking pleasure!
- **AT45DB081D[Page264]@SOIC8_F006AFAA.BIN** - Memory Chip Dump from a smart meter
- **GridStream_Decompressor.py** - Python program that mimics the LZSS decompression routing in the Collector
- **Long Packets.csv** - Raw data that was split up based on known (but not 100% sure) fields
- **Long Packets YouTube Example (Filtered).xlsx** - Data as seen in the YouTube video
- **Power Readings (00FF00-03) Labeled.xlsx** - Same as above but without the filters and resizing, same data set though
